El Dorado Web Portal

Frontend pages for a two-way marketing portal designed to more efficiently 
connect buyers and sellers of products in the life sciences industry.

Status:

views - html pages
stylesheets - css
scripts - javascript
images - (should be self explanatory)
data - used as a fake backend database for now

To-Do:

seller_dash - figure out what content will go there
screen size responsiveness
general styling and content adding
BACKEND

Tasks for next week:
Suruchi - styling/design for buyer
Max - project info page
Andre - start on backend

In progress: linking project info page with the project that is selected.
Currently just chooses first project in the list regardless of which was 
clicked. Will likely need to use GET params once backend framework is set up.
