El Dorado Web App Style Guide

For all files:

Indents: 4 spaces (not tabs)
Capitalization: all lowercase EXCEPT: angular modules and controllers

For javascript functions and variables camelCase is preferred (e.g. exampleJavascriptFunction = function () )

For css id and class names, uses dashes ('-') to separate lowercase words 
(e.g. class="css-example-class")

For file names, camelCase is also preferred.
